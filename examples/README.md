# Examples

These example scripts demonstrate the use of the code and illustrate several core features:

* [relaxation.py](/examples/relaxation.py) shows the configuration of 100 cells before and after relaxation.
* [active_FV.py](/examples/active_FV.py) shows the full active dynamics of the AFV model.
* [connections.py](/examples/connections.py) visualizes cell–cell connections in a simulation snapshot.
