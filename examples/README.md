# Examples

These are example scripts using the code, which also illustrates some of the most important features:

* [relaxation.py](/examples/relaxation.py) show the configurations of 100 cells before and after relaxation.
* [active_FV.py](/examples/active_FV.py) show the complete active dynamics of the AFV model.
* [connections.py](/examples/connections.py) show the cell-cell connections in a simulation snapshot.
