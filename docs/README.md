# Documentation for PyAFV

The documentation setup is adapted from the **Read the Docs** basic Sphinx example: https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic

To build the documentation locally, run the following commands from the repository root:
```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```
Then build the documentation with:
```bash
make html
```
or run:
```bash
make doctest
```
to execute and validate code blocks in the documentation.
