Welcome to PyAFV's documentation!
===================================

**PyAFV** is a Python implementation of the **active-finite-Voronoi (AFV) model** in 2D.

The AFV framework was introduced and developed in, for example, Refs. :cite:`huang2023bridging,teomy2018confluent,wang2026divergence`.

.. It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
.. and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` and :doc:`api` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
